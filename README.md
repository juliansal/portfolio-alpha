# PortfolioAlpha
This is a practice app to prepare for my future portfolio website. It'll be using Angular in the front-end.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
